## Introduction:
InterScope is an application that allows users to discover intriguing connections between two “unrelated” topics of the user’s choosing. Its primary utilization is for research and technical purposes, hypotheses, and methodologies for scientific experiments, allowing both professionals and students alike to delve further into niche research fields. InterScope is striving to develop a valuable exploration tool that will facilitate scientific breakthroughs and have a significant impact on researchers.

## Our Purpose:
According to data reported in 2021 from the National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics, approximately 47.2% of dissertation fields intersected 2 or more fields to lead to scientific breakthroughs. InterScope’s primary purpose is to spearhead these scientific breakthroughs by generating research topics merging 2 independent fields, such as “Bioinformatics” and “Artificial Intelligence”. We are reforming the way scientific research is approached and encouraging impact-based development globally. By combining two research interactions that have little to no prior published work, we are organizing a collective search for knowledge.

## Key Features:
- A home page featuring an “About” and “Get Started” section
- A topic selection page, prompting the user to enter two different topics, as well as enter a timeframe
- An output page showcasing a list of research keywords, hypothesis, methodologies, and other experimental procedures for research, and a regenerate button for further ideas.
- User Profile Page, featuring their username, password, and starred research procedures

## What we Learned:
During our development of InterScope, we learned many interesting things. Firstly, we were previously unaware of the importance of the intersection of research fields in leading scientific breakthroughs, at a rate of 47.2%. These included vaccinations, waste management, and more. In addition, through this project, we pushed ourselves to train and deploy an extremely ambitious model, one of our best works to date, although we had previously collaborated.

## Extensibility:
In the future, we aim to enhance InterScope’s user experience by enabling more dynamic interactions, allowing users to ask follow-up questions and receive detailed, tailored research proposals. We also plan to expand the platform’s guidance tools to better support users in pursuing their ideas beyond the initial suggestions. Additionally, we are committed to making InterScope more accessible, especially within research communities at the forefront of cross-disciplinary scientific innovation and discovery.
